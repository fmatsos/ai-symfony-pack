## Versioning System

This project uses a modified Semantic Versioning approach adapted for date-based releases:

**Format**: `YY.M.DD.X`

Where:
- `YY`: Year (two digits)
- `M`: Month (1-12)
- `DD`: Day (01-31)
- `X`: Increment for multiple generations on the same date

### Examples:
- `25.1.15.1`: First generation on January 15, 2025
- `25.1.15.2`: Second generation on January 15, 2025
- `25.3.08.1`: First generation on March 8, 2025

This versioning system allows for easy identification of when question sets were generated while maintaining compatibility with standard version management tools.
