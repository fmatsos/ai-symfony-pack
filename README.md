## Versioning System

We use a date-based versioning system with the format `YY.M.DD.X`:

-   **YY**: Two-digit year (e.g., `25` for 2025)
-   **M**: Month (1-12)
-   **DD**: Day (01-31)
-   **X**: An increment for multiple releases on the same day

**Examples:**
-   `25.1.15`: First release on January 15, 2025.
-   `25.1.15.1`: Second release on January 15, 2025.

This system makes it easy to see how recent the question sets are.
