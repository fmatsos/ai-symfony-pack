  - question: In Symfony 7, what is the recommended way to access an environment
      variable named `DATABASE_URL` within a service configuration, ensuring
      it's properly cast to a string?
    answers:
      - value: "%env(string:DATABASE_URL)%"
        correct: true
      - value: "%env(DATABASE_URL)%"
        correct: false

  - question: >-
      Consider the following Symfony configuration for the `Collection`
      constraint:


      ```yaml

      App\Entity\Order:
          properties:
              items:
                  - Collection:
                      allowExtraFields: false
                      fields:
                          product_id:
                              - NotBlank: ~
                          quantity:

                              - Type: integer
      ```


      If an `Order` object has an `items` array containing an element with an
      unexpected field, e.g., `{'product_id': 1, 'quantity': 2, 'extra_field':
      'value'}`, what will be the validation outcome?
    answers:
      - value: Validation will fail with an `extraFieldsMessage`.
        correct: true
      - value: Validation will pass, ignoring the extra field.
        correct: false
      - value: Validation will fail with a `missingFieldsMessage`.
        correct: false
      - value: An exception will be thrown.
        correct: false
    help: "The `allowExtraFields: false` option in the `Collection` constraint
      ensures that any fields not explicitly defined in `fields` will cause a
      validation error."
  - question: Which of the following `NoSuspiciousCharacters` constraint options is
      used to check for the presence of invisible characters like zero-width
      spaces?
    answers:

        correct: true
      - value: It automatically retries JSON operations if they fail.
        correct: false
      - value: It logs JSON errors to the Symfony logger.
