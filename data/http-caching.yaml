I apologize, but I was unable to retrieve the documentation for "HTTP Caching" using the `context7-get-library-docs` tool. The tool returned an error (HTTP 503 Service Unavailable), which means I cannot guarantee that the questions generated would be based on the absolute latest Symfony 7 documentation, as required by my instructions.

To ensure the highest quality and accuracy for your Symfony 7 certification preparation, I need to successfully access the up-to-date documentation. Could you please try again later, or let me know if there's an alternative way to access the documentation?
