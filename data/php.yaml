    help: As of PHP 8.0.0, when comparing a string to a numeric value using `==`,
      PHP no longer converts the string to a number if the string is not
      numeric. Instead, it converts the number to a string and performs a string
      comparison. Thus, `"0" == "a"` is `false`.

    help: PHP supports both the `array()` language construct and the short array
      syntax `[]` for creating arrays. Associative arrays are created by
      specifying key-value pairs. Individual elements can also be assigned using
      square bracket syntax.
  - question: Which statement is true regarding the `array()` construct in PHP?
    answers:
      - value: "`array()` is a language construct, not a regular function."
        correct: true

        correct: true
      - value: "`unset($var1) && unset($var2);`"
        correct: false
    help: The `unset()` language construct can take multiple comma-separated
      variable arguments to destroy them. Calling `unset()` multiple times for
      individual variables also works.
  - question: When migrating PHP 5 exception handlers to PHP 7, why might a handler
      type-hinted with `Exception` cause a fatal error?
    answers:
      - value: In PHP 7, `Error` objects (which are not `Exception` instances) can be
          thrown, and they implement the new `Throwable` interface.
        correct: true
      - value: The `Exception` class was removed in PHP 7.
        correct: false
      - value: PHP 7 requires all exception handlers to be defined as anonymous
          functions.
        correct: false
      - value: The `set_exception_handler()` function was deprecated in PHP 7.
        correct: false
    help: PHP 7 introduced the `Throwable` interface, which is the base interface
      for both `Error` and `Exception` classes. To catch both errors and
      exceptions, exception handlers should type-hint against `Throwable`.

      discouraged in OOP for better maintainability and testability.
  - question: In PHP, what is the purpose of the `private` visibility keyword for
      class members (properties and methods)?
    answers:
      - value: Members declared `private` can only be accessed from within the class
          that defines them.
        correct: true
      - value: Members declared `private` can be accessed by the class itself and its

      - value: Members declared `private` can be accessed from anywhere.
        correct: false
      - value: Members declared `private` are visible only to other objects of the same
          class.
        correct: false
    help: "`private` members are strictly accessible only within the class where
      they are declared. They are not accessible from outside the class or from

  - question: What is the purpose of the `final` keyword when applied to a class in PHP?
    answers:
      - value: It prevents the class from being extended by other classes.
        correct: true
      - value: It prevents methods within the class from being overridden.
        correct: false
      - value: It makes all methods in the class static.
        correct: false
      - value: It makes the class a singleton.
        correct: false
    help: When a class is declared `final`, it means it cannot be inherited from. No

      ?>
      ```

      What is the purpose of `as MyMailer` in the `use` statement?
    answers:
      - value: It creates an alias for the `App\Service\Mailer` class, allowing it to be
          referred to as `MyMailer` within the current file.
        correct: true
      - value: It renames the `App\Service\Mailer` class globally.
        correct: false
      - value: It specifies that `App\Service\Mailer` is a trait.
        correct: false
      - value: It defines a new namespace `MyMailer`.
        correct: false
    help: The `as` keyword in a `use` statement allows you to create an alias for a
      class, interface, function, or constant, resolving potential naming
      conflicts or providing a shorter, more convenient name.
  - question: Which of the following statements about PHP interfaces are true?

      - value: Interfaces can contain constants.
        correct: true
      - value: All methods declared in an interface must be public.
        correct: true
      - value: Interfaces can contain properties.
        correct: false
      - value: A class can implement multiple interfaces.
        correct: true
    help: Interfaces define a contract for classes. They can declare constants and
      public methods (without implementation). They cannot declare properties. A
      class can implement any number of interfaces.
  - question: What is an anonymous function (or closure) in PHP?
    answers:
      - value: A function that has no specified name.
        correct: true
      - value: A function that can access variables from the scope in which it was
          created, even after that scope has terminated.
        correct: true
      - value: A function that is automatically executed when a script starts.
        correct: false
      - value: A function that can only be defined inside a class.
        correct: false
    help: Anonymous functions are functions without a name. Closures are anonymous
      functions that can inherit variables from the parent scope using the `use`
      keyword.
  - question: |-
      Consider the following PHP code:

    answers:
      - value: Hello
        correct: true
      - value: Goodbye
        correct: false
      - value: An error, as `$message` is modified after the closure is defined.
        correct: false
      - value: Nothing, as `$message` is not passed by reference.
        correct: false
    help: When variables are imported into a closure using `use`, they are imported
      by value by default. Changes to the original variable outside the closure
      will not affect the variable inside the closure unless it is passed by
      reference (`use (&$message)`).
  - question: Which of the following statements about abstract classes in PHP are true?
    answers:
      - value: An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.
        correct: true
      - value: An abstract class must contain at least one abstract method.
        correct: false
      - value: Classes extending an abstract class must implement all its abstract
          methods.
        correct: true
      - value: Abstract methods must declare their visibility.
        correct: true
    help: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. They can contain abstract methods
      (methods without an implementation) but are not required to. Any class
      that extends an abstract class must implement all inherited abstract
      methods. Abstract methods must declare their visibility (public,
      protected).
  - question: What is the purpose of the `Throwable` interface introduced in PHP 7?
    answers:
      - value: It is the base interface for both `Error` and `Exception` classes,
          allowing a single `catch` block to handle both.
        correct: true
      - value: It replaces the `Exception` class entirely.
        correct: false
      - value: It provides methods for logging errors to a file.
        correct: false
      - value: It is used for type-hinting only in function parameters, not in `catch`
          blocks.
        correct: false
    help: The `Throwable` interface is the common ancestor of all objects that can
      be thrown via the `throw` statement, including both `Exception` and
      `Error` classes. This allows for more comprehensive error handling.
  - question: Which of the following is the correct way to throw a custom exception

    help: Custom exceptions must extend the built-in `Exception` class (or a class
      that extends `Exception`). They are thrown using the `throw new` syntax.
  - question: What is the purpose of a PHP Trait?
    answers:
      - value: To enable code reuse in single inheritance languages like PHP by allowing
          a class to use methods and properties from multiple traits.
        correct: true
      - value: To define an interface that a class must implement.
        correct: false
      - value: To create a singleton instance of a class.
        correct: false
      - value: To define abstract methods that must be implemented by child classes.
        correct: false
    help: Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages like
      PHP. A trait is intended to reduce the limitations of single inheritance
      by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several
      independent classes living in different class hierarchies.
  - question: Consider two traits, `TraitA` and `TraitB`, both defining a method
      `doSomething()`. If a class `MyClass` uses both traits, how can you
      resolve the method conflict?
    answers:
      - value: Using the `insteadof` operator.
        correct: true
      - value: Using the `as` operator to alias one of the methods.
        correct: true
      - value: By defining `doSomething()` directly in `MyClass` (which takes
          precedence).
        correct: true
      - value: By making one of the traits abstract.
        correct: false
    help: "PHP provides mechanisms to resolve method conflicts when using multiple
      traits: explicitly choosing which trait's method to use with `insteadof`,
      aliasing a method with `as`, or defining the method directly in the
      consuming class (which overrides trait methods)."
  - question: Which of the following is a common way to enable a PHP extension
      (e.g., `pdo_mysql`)?
    answers:
      - value: Adding `extension=pdo_mysql.so` (or `.dll` on Windows) to `php.ini`.
        correct: true
      - value: Running `composer require pdo_mysql`.
        correct: false
      - value: Using `dl('pdo_mysql.so');` in your PHP script.
        correct: false
      - value: Calling `enable_extension('pdo_mysql');` in your PHP script.
        correct: false
    help: PHP extensions are typically enabled by uncommenting or adding the
      `extension` directive in the `php.ini` configuration file. The file
      extension (`.so` for Unix/Linux, `.dll` for Windows) depends on the
      operating system.
  - question: What is the primary purpose of the Standard PHP Library (SPL)?
    answers:
      - value: To provide a collection of interfaces and classes for common data
          structures and iterators.
        correct: true
      - value: To replace all built-in PHP functions with object-oriented equivalents.
        correct: false
      - value: To offer a framework for building web applications.
        correct: false
      - value: To manage PHP's internal memory allocation.
        correct: false
    help: The SPL provides a set of interfaces and classes that solve standard
      problems, such as implementing data structures (stacks, queues, heaps) and
      providing iterators for various data sources.
  - question: Which SPL interface allows an object to be treated like an array,
      enabling access to its properties using array syntax (e.g.,
      `$obj['key']`)?
    answers:
      - value: "`ArrayAccess`"
        correct: true
      - value: "`Iterator`"
        correct: false
      - value: "`Countable`"
        correct: false
      - value: "`Serializable`"
        correct: false
    help: The `ArrayAccess` interface allows objects to use array-like syntax for
      accessing properties. It requires implementing methods like
      `offsetExists`, `offsetGet`, `offsetSet`, and `offsetUnset`.
  - question: Which SPL class provides a way to store objects and associate data
      with them, similar to a hash map where objects are keys?
    answers:
      - value: "`SplObjectStorage`"
        correct: true
      - value: "`SplFixedArray`"
        correct: false

      object's identity."
  - question: What is the purpose of the `declare(strict_types=1);` directive in PHP?
    answers:
      - value: It enables strict mode for type declarations (scalar type hints and
          return type declarations) in the current file.
        correct: true
      - value: It makes all variables strictly typed globally.
        correct: false
      - value: It forces all function arguments to be passed by reference.
        correct: false
      - value: It enables a faster execution mode for the script.
        correct: false
    help: The `declare(strict_types=1);` directive, when placed at the very top of a
      PHP file, enables strict mode for type declarations. In strict mode, if a
      value does not match the declared type, a `TypeError` is thrown instead of
      PHP attempting to coerce the value.
  - question: Which PHP 8.0 feature allows you to specify that a function parameter

      - value: "`public` members are accessible from anywhere, while `protected` members
          are accessible only within the class itself and its child classes."
        correct: true
      - value: "`public` members are accessible only within the class, while `protected`
          members are accessible from anywhere."
        correct: false
      - value: "`public` members are for properties only, `protected` for methods only."
        correct: false
      - value: There is no functional difference; it's a matter of convention.
        correct: false
    help: "`public` members have the widest visibility. `protected` members are
      accessible within the class itself and by any class that inherits from it,
      but not from outside the class hierarchy."
  - question: Which of the following correctly defines an abstract method in an
      abstract class?
    answers:

  - question: What is the purpose of the `__destruct()` magic method in PHP?
    answers:
      - value: It is called when the object is no longer referenced or when the script
          ends.
        correct: true
      - value: It is called immediately after the constructor.
        correct: false
      - value: It is used to explicitly delete an object from memory.
        correct: false
      - value: It is called when an error occurs within the object's methods.
        correct: false
    help: The destructor method `__destruct()` is called when the object is garbage
      collected, which typically happens when there are no more references to
      the object or at the end of script execution.
  - question: Which of the following is true about PHP's `E_NOTICE` error level?
    answers:
      - value: It indicates a run-time notice that the script encountered something that
          could indicate an error, but could also happen in the normal course of
          running a script.
        correct: true
      - value: It indicates a fatal run-time error that cannot be recovered from.
        correct: false
      - value: It indicates a compile-time parse error.
        correct: false
      - value: It indicates a warning that is not fatal but should be addressed.
        correct: false
    help: "`E_NOTICE` errors are minor issues that PHP encounters during runtime.
      They are typically non-critical and the script continues to execute, but
      they often point to potential bugs or bad practices."
  - question: In PHP 8.2, what is the correct way to define a read-only property?
    answers:

    help: The `Iterator` interface (part of SPL) specifies an interface for objects
      that can be iterated over, such as in a `foreach` loop. Classes
      implementing `Iterator` must provide `current()`, `key()`, `next()`,
      `rewind()`, and `valid()` methods.
  - question: What is the purpose of the `static` keyword when used with a class method?
    answers:
      - value: The method can be called without creating an instance of the class.
        correct: true
      - value: The method can only access static properties of the class.
        correct: false
      - value: The method becomes a global function.
        correct: false
      - value: The method's logic is shared across all instances of the class.
        correct: true
    help: Static methods belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance.
      They can be called directly on the class using the `::` operator (e.g.,
      `ClassName::method()`) and cannot access `$this`.
  - question: Which PHP 8.1 feature allows you to define constants within a class
      that can be used in property default values, static variable initializers,
