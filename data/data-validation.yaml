              }
              // ...
          }
      }
      ```

      What is the type of the `$errors` variable if validation fails?
    answers:
      - value: Symfony\Component\Validator\ConstraintViolationList
        correct: true
      - value: array
        correct: false
      - value: Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response
        correct: false
      - value: string
        correct: false
    help: The `validate()` method of `ValidatorInterface` returns a
      `ConstraintViolationList` object, which is a collection of
      `ConstraintViolation` objects.
  - question: Which of the following methods can be used to define validation
      metadata for a Symfony entity?
    answers:
      - value: PHP Attributes (`#[Assert\NotBlank]`)
        correct: true
      - value: YAML configuration files (e.g., `config/validator/validation.yaml`)
        correct: true
      - value: XML configuration files (e.g., `config/validator/validation.xml`)
        correct: true
      - value: A static `loadValidatorMetadata(ClassMetadata $metadata)` method within
          the entity class
        correct: true
      - value: Directly in the entity's constructor
        correct: false
    help: Symfony provides multiple ways to define validation constraints, including
      PHP attributes, YAML, XML, and programmatic definition via
      `loadValidatorMetadata`.
  - question: Which constraint should be used to ensure that a nested object's
      properties are also validated when the parent object is validated?
    answers:
      - value: Assert\Valid
        correct: true
      - value: Assert\Collection
        correct: false
      - value: Assert\Type
        correct: false
      - value: Assert\All
        correct: false
    help: The `Valid` constraint is specifically designed to trigger validation on
      associated objects or collections.
  - question: What is the purpose of the `validator.initializer` service tag in Symfony?
    answers:
      - value: To register a service that initializes objects before validation,
          ensuring all data (e.g., lazily-loaded) is present.
        correct: true
      - value: To define a custom validation constraint.
        correct: false
      - value: To automatically inject the `ValidatorInterface` into a service.
        correct: false
      - value: To configure a specific validation group for a service.
        correct: false
    help: The `validator.initializer` tag is used for services implementing
      `ObjectInitializerInterface` to prepare objects, especially for
      lazily-loaded data, before validation occurs.
  - question: Which of the following built-in Symfony validation constraints is used
      to check if a value falls within a specified numerical or date range?
    answers:
      - value: Range
        correct: true
      - value: Length
        correct: false
      - value: GreaterThan
        correct: false
      - value: Between
        correct: false
    help: The `Range` constraint validates if a value is between a minimum and
      maximum, supporting both numbers and `DateTime` objects.
  - question: To ensure a string is not empty and has a minimum length of 10
      characters, which combination of built-in Symfony constraints would you
      apply?
    answers:
      - value: "NotBlank and Length (min: 10)"

      - value: "Required and StringLength (min: 10)"
        correct: false
      - value: "NotEmpty and Length (min: 10)"
        correct: false
    help: The `NotBlank` constraint checks for non-empty values (including
      non-whitespace strings), and `Length` with `min` option checks the minimum
      length.
  - question: Which constraint is suitable for validating that a collection (e.g.,
      an array) contains a specific number of elements within a given range?
    answers:
      - value: Count
        correct: true
      - value: Collection
        correct: false
      - value: Length

        correct: true
      - value: number
        correct: true
      - value: custom_type
        correct: false
    help: The `Type` constraint supports PHP native types, FQCNs, ctype functions,
      and aggregated types like 'number' and 'finite-float'.
  - question: How can you specify a custom error message for a validation constraint
      in Symfony?
    answers:
      - value: By setting the `message` option of the constraint.
        correct: true
      - value: By overriding the `__toString()` method of the constraint.
        correct: false
      - value: By defining a translation key in `messages.en.xlf`.
        correct: false
      - value: By using the `setErrorMessage()` method on the `ValidatorInterface`.
        correct: false
    help: Most built-in constraints have a `message` option to customize the error
      message displayed when the constraint is violated.
  - question: Which constraint allows you to validate a value against a PHP
      expression, potentially using custom variables?
    answers:
      - value: Expression
        correct: true
      - value: Callback
        correct: false
      - value: IsTrue
        correct: false
      - value: EqualTo
        correct: false
    help: The `Expression` constraint evaluates a Symfony ExpressionLanguage
      expression, allowing complex validation logic, and can accept custom
      `values`.
  - question: When using the `Collection` constraint, how do you define a field that
      must be present and validated, versus a field that is optional but
      validated if present?
    answers:
      - value: Use `Assert\Required` for mandatory fields and `Assert\Optional` for
          optional fields.
        correct: true
      - value: Use `Assert\NotNull` for mandatory fields and `Assert\Nullable` for
          optional fields.
        correct: false
      - value: Use `Assert\NotBlank` for mandatory fields and `Assert\AllowEmpty` for
          optional fields.
        correct: false
      - value: The `Collection` constraint does not support optional fields.
        correct: false
    help: Inside a `Collection` constraint, `Required` ensures a key exists and its
      constraints are applied, while `Optional` only applies its constraints if
      the key is present.
  - question: What is the 'Default' validation group in Symfony?
    answers:
      - value: It's the group automatically applied to constraints that do not
          explicitly specify a group.
        correct: true
      - value: It's a special group that always validates all constraints, regardless of
          their defined groups.
        correct: false
      - value: It's a group that is only used when no other groups are specified during
          validation.
        correct: false
      - value: It's a group that can only be used for class-level constraints.
        correct: false
    help: Constraints without an explicit group are automatically assigned to the
      'Default' group. When `validate()` is called without specifying groups,
      the 'Default' group is used.
  - question: How can you validate an object against a specific custom validation
      group, for example, 'registration'?
    answers:
      - value: $validator->validate($object, null, ['registration']);
        correct: true
      - value: $validator->validate($object, 'registration');
        correct: false
      - value: $validator->validate($object)->forGroup('registration');
        correct: false
      - value: $validator->validate($object, ['groups' => 'registration']);
        correct: false
    help: The third argument to the `validate()` method of `ValidatorInterface` is
      an array of validation groups to apply.
  - question: When a form is submitted in Symfony, and you want to apply specific
      validation rules based on the submitted data (e.g., different rules for
      'person' vs. 'company' type), how can you achieve this?
    answers:
      - value: By setting the `validation_groups` option in `configureOptions()` to a
          Closure that returns an array of group names.
        correct: true
      - value: By calling `$form->setValidationGroups()` after `handleRequest()`.
        correct: false
      - value: By using a `#[ConditionalValidation]` attribute on the form type.
        correct: false
      - value: By creating separate form types for each validation scenario.
        correct: false
    help: The `validation_groups` option in a form type's `configureOptions()`
      method can accept a Closure that dynamically determines the groups based
      on the form's data.
  - question: If you set `validation_groups` to `false` on a Symfony form, what is
      the effect?
    answers:
      - value: Most validation rules defined for the form's data class are bypassed.
        correct: true
      - value: All validation, including basic integrity checks, is completely disabled.
        correct: false
      - value: Only the 'Default' validation group is applied.
        correct: false
      - value: It forces all validation groups to be applied.
        correct: false
    help: Setting `validation_groups` to `false` disables most validation, but basic
      integrity checks (like file size) still apply.
  - question: What is the primary purpose of a validation group sequence in Symfony?
    answers:
      - value: To define an ordered list of validation groups, where subsequent groups
          are only validated if preceding groups pass.
        correct: true
      - value: To group related constraints together for easier management.
        correct: false
      - value: To apply validation constraints to a collection of objects.
        correct: false
      - value: To specify which properties of an object should be validated.
        correct: false
    help: A group sequence allows you to define a step-by-step validation process,
      stopping at the first group that causes a violation.
  - question: How can you define a validation group sequence for an entity in Symfony?
    answers:
      - value: By implementing
          `Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\GroupSequenceProviderInterface`
          on the entity.
        correct: true
      - value: By using the `#[GroupSequence]` attribute on the entity class.
        correct: true
      - value: By configuring a `group_sequence` option in the validation YAML/XML.
        correct: true
      - value: By passing an array of group names to the `validate()` method.
        correct: false
    help: Group sequences can be defined via attributes, configuration files, or by
      implementing `GroupSequenceProviderInterface` for dynamic sequences.
  - question: When using a dynamic group sequence provider, which method on the
      entity class is typically responsible for returning the array of
      validation groups?
    answers:
      - value: getValidationGroups()
        correct: true
      - value: determineValidationGroups()
        correct: false
      - value: resolveGroups()
        correct: false
      - value: getGroupsToValidate()
        correct: false
    help: When an entity implements `GroupSequenceProviderInterface`, the
      `getValidationGroups()` method is called to determine the sequence.
  - question: You have a form with a 'Save Draft' button that should not trigger
      full validation. How would you configure this button in your form type?
    answers:
      - value: ->add('saveDraft', SubmitType::class, ['validation_groups' => false])
        correct: true
      - value: ->add('saveDraft', SubmitType::class, ['validate' => false])
        correct: false
      - value: ->add('saveDraft', SubmitType::class, ['skip_validation' => true])
        correct: false
      - value: ->add('saveDraft', SubmitType::class, ['groups' => []])
        correct: false
    help: Setting `validation_groups` to `false` for a specific button ensures that
      clicking it bypasses most validation rules for the form.
  - question: What is the purpose of a custom callback validator in Symfony?
    answers:
      - value: To implement complex validation logic that cannot be achieved with
          built-in constraints.
        correct: true
      - value: To replace existing built-in constraints with custom implementations.
        correct: false
      - value: To define new validation groups dynamically.
        correct: false
      - value: To modify the validated value before applying constraints.
        correct: false
    help: Custom callback validators are used when the validation logic is too
      specific or complex for standard constraints, allowing direct access to
      the validated object and the validator context.
  - question: To create a custom validation constraint, what two main
      classes/interfaces do you typically need to define?
    answers:
      - value: A custom constraint class extending
          `Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraint` and a custom validator class
          extending `Symfony\Component\Validator\ConstraintValidator`.
        correct: true
      - value: A custom constraint class and a custom `ValidationRule` interface.
        correct: false
      - value: A custom `ValidatorInterface` implementation and a `ValidationFactory`.
        correct: false
      - value: A custom `ValidationService` and a `ValidationHelper`.
        correct: false
    help: A custom constraint defines the rule, and its associated validator
      implements the logic to check that rule.
  - question: Inside a custom constraint validator's `validate()` method, how do you
      add a validation violation?
    answers:
      - value: Use `$this->context->buildViolation('Your
          message')->atPath('propertyPath')->addViolation();`
        correct: true
      - value: Use `$this->addError('Your message');`
        correct: false
      - value: Return a new `ConstraintViolation` object.
        correct: false
      - value: Throw a `ValidationException`.
        correct: false
    help: The `context` property of `ConstraintValidator` provides the
      `buildViolation()` method to construct and add violations.
  - question: Which service tag is used to register a custom constraint validator in
      Symfony's service container?
    answers:
      - value: validator.constraint_validator
        correct: true
      - value: validator.initializer
        correct: false
      - value: form.type
        correct: false
      - value: kernel.event_subscriber
        correct: false
    help: The `validator.constraint_validator` tag informs Symfony that a service is
      a custom validator for a specific constraint.
  - question: What is the purpose of the `setParameter()` method when building a
      violation in a custom validator?
    answers:
      - value: To replace placeholders in the violation message (e.g., `{{ value }}`).
        correct: true
      - value: To define the path to the invalid property.
        correct: false
      - value: To set the severity level of the violation.
        correct: false
      - value: To pass additional data to the constraint.
        correct: false
    help: "`setParameter()` allows you to provide values for placeholders defined in
      your constraint's error message, making messages dynamic."
  - question: When unit testing a custom Symfony constraint validator, which base
      class should your test extend?
    answers:
      - value: Symfony\Component\Validator\Test\ConstraintValidatorTestCase
        correct: true
      - value: PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
        correct: false
      - value: Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase
        correct: false
      - value: Symfony\Component\Form\Test\TypeTestCase
        correct: false
    help: "`ConstraintValidatorTestCase` provides helper methods for easily testing
      custom validators, such as `assertNoViolation()` and
      `buildViolation()->assertRaised()`."
  - question: What is a `ConstraintViolationList` in Symfony's Validator component?
    answers:
      - value: A collection of `ConstraintViolation` objects, representing all
          validation errors found.
        correct: true
      - value: A list of all constraints applied to an object.
        correct: false
      - value: An object that defines the validation groups for an entity.
        correct: false
      - value: A service that builds validation constraints.
        correct: false
    help: The `ConstraintViolationList` is the return type of the `validate()`
      method and holds all individual validation errors.
  - question: How do you access the error message of a single validation violation
      from a `ConstraintViolation` object?
    answers:
      - value: Using the `getMessage()` method.
        correct: true
      - value: Using the `getErrorMessage()` method.
        correct: false
      - value: Accessing the `message` property directly.
        correct: false
      - value: Calling `__toString()` on the violation.
        correct: false
    help: The `ConstraintViolation` object provides methods like `getMessage()`,
      `getPropertyPath()`, and `getInvalidValue()` to inspect the violation
      details.
  - question: What information does the `getPropertyPath()` method of a
      `ConstraintViolation` object provide?
    answers:
      - value: The path to the property that caused the validation error (e.g.,
          `address.zipCode`).
        correct: true
      - value: The full file path of the entity class.
        correct: false
      - value: The route path associated with the validation error.
        correct: false
      - value: The name of the validation group that failed.
        correct: false
    help: "`getPropertyPath()` is crucial for identifying exactly which property
      (including nested ones) failed validation."
  - question: What is the `payload` option of a validation constraint used for?
    answers:
      - value: To attach arbitrary custom data to a constraint violation, often used for
          severity or custom error handling.
        correct: true
      - value: To define the data that will be validated by the constraint.
        correct: false
      - value: To specify the HTTP method for the validation request.
        correct: false
      - value: To encrypt the validation error messages.
        correct: false
    help: The `payload` option allows developers to embed additional,
      non-validation-specific data with a constraint, which can be retrieved
      from the `ConstraintViolation`.
  - question: When validating a scalar value (e.g., a single email string) using
      `ValidatorInterface`, how do you pass the constraint?
    answers:
      - value: As the second argument to the `validate()` method.
        correct: true
      - value: As the first argument to the `validate()` method.
        correct: false
      - value: By calling `setConstraint()` on the validator.
        correct: false
      - value: It's not possible to validate scalar values directly.
        correct: false
    help: The `validate()` method signature is `validate($value, $constraints =
      null, $groups = null)`. For scalar values, `$value` is the string and
      `$constraints` is the constraint object.
  - question: Which of the following describes the behavior of
      `Symfony\Component\Validator\Validation::createCallable()`?
    answers:
      - value: It returns a closure that throws a `ValidationFailedException` if
          constraints are not matched.
        correct: true
      - value: It returns a closure that returns `false` if constraints are not matched.
        correct: false
      - value: It creates a new `ValidatorInterface` instance.
        correct: false
      - value: It's used to define custom validation constraints.
        correct: false
    help: "`createCallable()` is useful for integrating validation into components
      like Console `Question` helpers or `OptionsResolver` where exceptions are
      preferred for invalid input."
  - question: You want to validate that a user's age is greater than 18. Which
      built-in constraint would you use?
    answers:
      - value: GreaterThan
        correct: true
      - value: Min
        correct: false
      - value: "Range (min: 19)"
        correct: true
      - value: Positive
        correct: false
    help: "`GreaterThan` directly checks if a value is greater than a specified
      value. `Range` with only a `min` value can also achieve this."
  - question: Consider a scenario where you have a `User` entity with a `creditCard`
      property. You want to validate the `creditCard` only if the user is a
      'Premium' user. How would you associate the `CardScheme` constraint with a
      'Premium' validation group?
    answers:
      - value: "#[Assert\\CardScheme(schemes: [Assert\\CardScheme::VISA], groups:
          ['Premium'])]"
        correct: true
      - value: "#[Assert\\CardScheme(schemes: [Assert\\CardScheme::VISA], when:
          'isPremium()')]`"
        correct: false
      - value: "#[Assert\\CardScheme(schemes:

        correct: false
      - value: "`$form->submit($request->request->all());` then `$form->isValid();`"
        correct: false
    help: "`handleRequest()` processes the request and populates the form, after
      which `isSubmitted()` and `isValid()` can be reliably checked."
  - question: You are building a form that is NOT mapped to a data class. How do you
      add validation constraints directly to a form field?
    answers:
      - value: By passing a `constraints` option to the `add()` method of the form
          builder, containing an instance of the constraint or an array of
          constraints.
        correct: true
      - value: By defining constraints in the `configureOptions()` method of the form
          type.
        correct: false
      - value: By using PHP attributes on the form field's variable in the controller.
        correct: false
      - value: Validation is not possible for forms not mapped to a data class.
        correct: false
    help: The `constraints` option in `FormBuilderInterface::add()` allows you to
      apply validation rules directly to individual form fields.
  - question: What happens if a data transformer throws a
      `TransformationFailedException` during `reverseTransform()`?
    answers:
      - value: The form will be marked as invalid, and the error message from the
          exception can be displayed.
        correct: true
      - value: The application will crash with a fatal error.
        correct: false
      - value: The form will silently ignore the invalid data.
        correct: false
      - value: The exception is caught, but no error message is propagated to the form.
        correct: false
    help: Throwing `TransformationFailedException` is the correct way to signal a
      data transformation error, which Symfony then converts into a form
      validation error.
  - question: Which method of `Symfony\Component\Validator\Validation` returns a
      closure that returns `false` if constraints are not matched, instead of
      throwing an exception?
    answers:
      - value: createIsValidCallable()
        correct: true
      - value: createCallable()
        correct: false
      - value: createValidator()
        correct: false

        correct: false
      - value: Assert\List with Assert\Object.
        correct: false
    help: The `All` constraint applies a set of constraints to each element of a
      collection. `Collection` is then used to define constraints for the keys
      within each nested array.
  - question: How can you integrate the Symfony Validator component with the Form
      component to enable automatic validation of form data?
    answers:
      - value: By adding `ValidatorExtension` to the `FormFactoryBuilder` and providing
          a `ValidatorInterface` instance.
        correct: true
      - value: By calling `$form->setValidator($validator);` after creating the form.
        correct: false
      - value: By enabling a specific configuration option in `framework.yaml`.
        correct: false
      - value: It's automatically integrated when both components are installed.

    help: The `ValidatorExtension` bridges the Form and Validator components,
      allowing forms to leverage the validation system.
  - question: When validating a DTO (Data Transfer Object) used with
      `#[MapQueryParameter]`, where should you define the validation
      constraints?
    answers:
      - value: As PHP attributes directly on the DTO properties.
        correct: true
      - value: In a separate validation YAML/XML file for the DTO.
        correct: true
      - value: In the controller method where the DTO is mapped.
        correct: false
      - value: Within the `MapQueryParameter` attribute itself.
        correct: false
    help: DTOs are regular PHP objects, so standard Symfony validation methods
      (attributes, YAML, XML, `loadValidatorMetadata`) apply.
  - question: "What is the primary benefit of using `#[MapQueryParameter(filter:
      \\FILTER_VALIDATE_INT)]` in a controller action?"
    answers:
      - value: It automatically validates and casts the query parameter to an integer,
          throwing an error if invalid.
        correct: true
      - value: It only casts the parameter to an integer without validation.
        correct: false
      - value: It's a shortcut for applying a `Type` constraint.
        correct: false
      - value: It prevents the parameter from being null.
        correct: false
    help: The `filter` option with PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_*` constants provides
      built-in validation and type casting for mapped parameters.
  - question: You need to validate that a `DateTimeInterface` property, `startDate`,
      falls between 'first day of January' and 'first day of January next year'.
      Which constraint and options would you use?
    answers:
      - value: "Assert\\Range(min: 'first day of January', max: 'first day of January

        correct: true
    help: The `Type` constraint supports standard PHP datatypes (e.g., `string`,
      `int`, `array`, `object`, `callable`, `resource`, `null`) and ctype
      functions, but not 'json' directly.
  - question: What is the primary difference between `NotBlank` and `NotNull`
      constraints?
    answers:
      - value: "`NotBlank` checks for non-empty values (including non-whitespace
          strings), while `NotNull` only checks if the value is not `null`."
        correct: true
      - value: "`NotBlank` is for strings, `NotNull` is for objects."
        correct: false
      - value: "`NotBlank` allows empty strings, `NotNull` does not."
        correct: false
      - value: They are functionally identical.
        correct: false
    help: "`NotBlank` is stricter than `NotNull`. A string containing only
      whitespace is considered 'not blank' by `NotNull` but 'blank' by
      `NotBlank`."
  - question: When validating a form, if you use `$form->submit($data, false);`
      (where `false` is `clearMissing`), what is the implication for validation?
    answers:
      - value: Only submitted fields will be validated; fields not present in `$data`
          will not trigger validation errors.
        correct: true
      - value: All fields will be validated, and missing fields will be set to `null`.
        correct: false
      - value: Validation is completely bypassed for all fields.
        correct: false
      - value: It forces validation on all fields, even if they are not submitted.
        correct: false
    help: Setting `clearMissing` to `false` means that the form will only validate
      the fields explicitly present in the submitted data, ignoring any fields
      that are missing from the payload.
  - question: You want to validate a console question's input using a regular
      expression. Which component and method would you use to set up this
      validation?

      - value: To check if a value matches a specific regular expression.
        correct: false
    help: The `Choice` constraint is ideal for validating against enums, dropdown
      selections, or any fixed list of options.
  - question: When defining validation constraints for an entity using YAML, what is
      the correct top-level key to specify the entity class?
    answers:
      - value: The fully qualified class name (FQCN) of the entity, e.g.,
          `App\Entity\Author:`
        correct: true
      - value: The short class name, e.g., `Author:`
        correct: false

        correct: false
      - value: The bundle name, e.g., `AppBundle:`
        correct: false
    help: YAML and XML validation definitions use the FQCN to map constraints to
      specific classes.
  - question: Which of the following describes the behavior of validation groups
      when dealing with inheritance (e.g., `User extends BaseUser`)?
    answers:
      - value: Validating with a subclass name (e.g., 'User') validates constraints in
          both the subclass and base class.
        correct: true
      - value: Validating with a base class name (e.g., 'BaseUser') validates
          constraints in both the base class and any subclasses.
        correct: false
      - value: Validation groups are ignored in inheritance scenarios.
        correct: false
      - value: Only constraints explicitly defined on the exact class name used for
          validation are applied.
        correct: false
    help: Symfony's validator handles inheritance by applying constraints from the
      specified class and its ancestors when validating with a subclass group,
      but only from the specified class when using a base class group.
  - question: What is the purpose of `OptionsResolver::setAllowedTypes()` in a
      Symfony form type's `configureOptions()` method?
    answers:
      - value: To enforce specific data types for the options passed to the form type.
        correct: true
      - value: To define the data types for the form fields themselves.
        correct: false
      - value: To specify the allowed MIME types for file uploads.
        correct: false
      - value: To set the default values for form options.
        correct: false
    help: "`setAllowedTypes()` ensures that the options passed to a form type (e.g.,
      `data_class`, `validation_groups`) conform to expected PHP types, throwing
      an `InvalidOptionsException` if not."
  - question: You want to ensure a `Product` entity's `price` property is a positive
      number. Which constraint is most appropriate?
    answers:
      - value: Assert\Positive

      - value: Assert\Min(1)
        correct: false
    help: "`Positive` checks if a number is strictly greater than zero.
      `GreaterThan(0)` achieves the same. `Range(min: 0.01)` also ensures a
      positive value."
  - question: What is the role of the `data_class` option in a Symfony form type?
    answers:
      - value: It tells the form which class its submitted data should be mapped to,
          enabling automatic data binding and validation.
        correct: true
      - value: It defines the HTML `class` attribute for the form element.
        correct: false
      - value: It specifies the database table associated with the form.
        correct: false
      - value: It's used to set the default value for the form.
        correct: false
    help: The `data_class` option is fundamental for mapping form data to an
      underlying PHP object and leveraging its validation constraints.
  - question: When validating an object with embedded objects (e.g., `Author` has an
      `Address`), how do validation groups behave for the embedded objects if
      the parent is validated with the 'Default' group?
    answers:
      - value: Constraints in the 'Default' group of the embedded objects are also
          validated.
        correct: true
      - value: No constraints on embedded objects are validated unless explicitly
          specified.
        correct: false
      - value: Only constraints in the 'Default' group of the parent object are
          validated.
        correct: false
      - value: All constraints on embedded objects are validated, regardless of their
          group.
        correct: false
    help: When the 'Default' group is applied to a parent object, it automatically
      cascades to the 'Default' group of any embedded objects marked with
      `#[Assert\Valid]`.
  - question: Which of the following is a valid way to define a custom validation
      constraint in Symfony?
    answers:
      - value: Creating a class that extends `Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraint`.

      and `max` options.
  - question: When validating an object, if you specify a class name as a validation
      group (e.g., `User::class`), how does it behave compared to the 'Default'
      group?
    answers:
      - value: It behaves identically to 'Default' unless the class is embedded in
          another object being validated.
        correct: true
      - value: It only validates constraints explicitly assigned to that class name
          group.
        correct: false
      - value: It validates all constraints on the object, regardless of group.
        correct: false
      - value: It's a deprecated way of specifying validation groups.
        correct: false
    help: The class name as a group acts like 'Default' for the top-level object,
      but for embedded objects, it restricts validation to constraints
      explicitly in that class name group.

  - question: When should you prefer using a custom callback validator over a simple
      `Expression` constraint?
    answers:
      - value: When the validation logic is complex, involves external dependencies
          (e.g., database queries), or requires more structured code.
        correct: true
      - value: Only when validating scalar values.
        correct: false
      - value: When you need to define a new validation group.
        correct: false

    help: Callback validators offer full programmatic control and are suitable for
      scenarios beyond simple expression evaluation, such as integrating with
      services or complex business rules.
  - question: What is the main advantage of defining validation metadata using PHP
      attributes compared to YAML or XML files?
    answers:
      - value: Constraints are defined directly within the class, improving
          discoverability and co-location of related code.
        correct: true
      - value: It offers better performance due to compile-time optimization.
        correct: false
      - value: It allows for more complex validation logic than other formats.
        correct: false
      - value: It's the only way to define class-level constraints.
        correct: false
    help: PHP attributes (introduced in PHP 8) provide a modern and convenient way
      to define metadata directly on classes, properties, and methods.

  - question: What is the purpose of the `normalizer` option available on some
      Symfony validation constraints (e.g., `Unique`)?
    answers:
      - value: A PHP callable applied to the value before validation, useful for
          preprocessing (e.g., trimming whitespace).
        correct: true
      - value: To convert the error message into a specific format.
        correct: false
      - value: To normalize the property path of a violation.

      `json_decode()`.
  - question: When using `Validation::createValidator()`, what is the default
      behavior regarding validation translations?
    answers:
      - value: Built-in validation translations for core error messages are loaded
          automatically if the Translation component is available.
        correct: true
      - value: No translations are loaded by default; they must be manually added.
        correct: false
      - value: Only English translations are loaded by default.
        correct: false
      - value: It depends on the system's locale settings.
        correct: false
    help: Symfony's Validator component integrates with the Translation component to
      provide localized error messages out of the box for common constraints.

        correct: false
    help: The `Collection` constraint allows you to define rules for specific keys
      within an array, including nesting other constraints.
  - question: Which of the following describes a 'class name' validation group
      (e.g., 'App\Entity\User')?
    answers:
      - value: It behaves identically to the 'Default' group for the top-level object
          being validated.
        correct: true
      - value: It only validates constraints explicitly assigned to that specific class
          name group.
        correct: false
      - value: It is automatically applied when validating any instance of that class.
        correct: false
      - value: It is a deprecated feature in Symfony 7.
        correct: false
    help: The class name group is a special group that acts like 'Default' for the
      root object but provides more granular control for embedded objects.
  - question: What is the purpose of `ConstraintViolation::getInvalidValue()`?
    answers:
      - value: To retrieve the actual value that failed validation.
        correct: true
      - value: To get the expected valid value for the constraint.
        correct: false
      - value: To obtain a normalized version of the invalid value.
        correct: false
      - value: To get the name of the constraint that failed.
        correct: false
    help: "`getInvalidValue()` allows you to inspect the exact data that caused the
      validation error, which is useful for debugging or detailed error
      messages."
  - question: You want to ensure a string property `tag` is not blank and is a
      string. Which constraints would you apply?
    answers:
      - value: Assert\NotBlank and Assert\Type('string')
        correct: true
      - value: Assert\NotNull and Assert\String
        correct: false
      - value: Assert\Required and Assert\Scalar
        correct: false
      - value: Assert\NotEmpty and Assert\Text
        correct: false
    help: "`NotBlank` ensures the value is not empty or just whitespace.
      `Type('string')` confirms it's a string."
  - question: What is the role of the `ConstraintViolationListInterface` in
      Symfony's validation process?
    answers:
      - value: It represents a collection of validation errors, allowing iteration and
          access to individual violations.
        correct: true
      - value: It defines the contract for creating new validation constraints.
        correct: false
      - value: It's an internal interface not meant for direct use by developers.
        correct: false
      - value: It provides methods for adding new validation rules to the validator.
        correct: false
    help: The `ConstraintViolationListInterface` is the standard way to handle and
      process validation results, providing methods like `count()` and
      iteration.
  - question: When validating an object with a group sequence, if a violation occurs
      in an earlier group in the sequence, what happens to subsequent groups?
    answers:
      - value: Subsequent groups in the sequence are skipped, and no further validation
          is performed.
        correct: true
      - value: All groups in the sequence are always validated, regardless of earlier
          failures.
        correct: false
      - value: Only the 'Default' group is then validated.
        correct: false
      - value: The validation process restarts from the beginning of the sequence.
        correct: false
    help: The 'fail-fast' nature of group sequences means validation stops as soon
      as a violation is found in any group within the sequence.
  - question: You need to validate that a user's `age` is an integer and greater
      than 18. Which constraints would you apply?
    answers:
      - value: Assert\Type('int') and Assert\GreaterThan(18)
        correct: true
      - value: Assert\Integer and Assert\Min(19)
        correct: true
      - value: Assert\Numeric and Assert\Positive
        correct: false
      - value: "Assert\\Number and Assert\\Range(min: 19)"
        correct: true
    help: "Multiple combinations can achieve this. `Type('int')` ensures it's an
      integer, and `GreaterThan(18)` or `Min(19)` ensures the age condition.
      `Range(min: 19)` also works."
  - question: What is the purpose of the `message` option in a validation constraint?
    answers:
      - value: To define the error message displayed to the user if the constraint is
          violated.
        correct: true
      - value: To provide a unique identifier for the constraint.
        correct: false
      - value: To specify the logging level for validation errors.
        correct: false
      - value: To set a default value for the validated property.
        correct: false
    help: The `message` option is standard across most constraints for customizing
      user-facing error messages.
  - question: Which constraint is used to validate that a value is a valid country
      code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)?
    answers:
      - value: Assert\Country
        correct: true
      - value: Assert\Locale
        correct: false

    help: The `Country` constraint specifically validates against a list of ISO
      3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.
  - question: How can you retrieve the constraint object that caused a specific
      `ConstraintViolation`?
    answers:
      - value: Using the `getConstraint()` method on the `ConstraintViolation` object.
        correct: true
      - value: Using the `getRule()` method on the `ConstraintViolation` object.
        correct: false
      - value: Accessing the `constraint` property directly.
        correct: false
      - value: It's not possible to retrieve the original constraint.
        correct: false
    help: The `getConstraint()` method returns the `Constraint` object that was
      violated, allowing inspection of its properties and options.
