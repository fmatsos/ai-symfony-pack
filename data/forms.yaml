I apologize, but I was unable to retrieve the latest documentation for Symfony Forms due to a timeout error when trying to access the `context7-get-library-docs` tool.

Without access to the most up-to-date documentation, I cannot guarantee the 100% accuracy required for certification-level questions, especially given the strict constraint that "Every question, answer, and explanation must be 100% accurate, according to the official Symfony 7 and PHP 8.2 documentation." and "The output will be validated by a certified Symfony expert."

To ensure I provide you with the highest quality and most accurate questions for your Symfony 7 certification preparation, I need to successfully fetch the documentation.

Could you please let me know if there's anything I can do to resolve the timeout issue, or if you'd like me to try again?
