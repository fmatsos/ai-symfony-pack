  - question: Which of the following methods is used in a Symfony controller to
      create a form based on a specific form type class?
    answers:
      - value: "`$this->createForm(TaskType::class, $task);`"
        correct: true
      - value: "`$this->buildForm(TaskType::class, $task);`"
        correct: false
      - value: "`$this->getForm(TaskType::class, $task);`"
        correct: false
      - value: "`$this->formFactory->create(TaskType::class, $task);`"
        correct: false
    help: The `createForm()` method, available in controllers extending
      `AbstractController`, is used to instantiate a form from a dedicated form
      type class. https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html#_snippet_6
  - question: What is the primary purpose of the `handleRequest()` method when
      processing a Symfony form submission?
    answers:
      - value: To populate the form with submitted data from the request.
        correct: true
      - value: To render the form in the Twig template.
        correct: false
      - value: To validate the form data against defined constraints.
        correct: false
      - value: To redirect the user to a success page after submission.
        correct: false
    help: The `handleRequest()` method processes the request to determine if the

  - question: When defining a custom form type in Symfony, which method is used to
      add fields to the form?
    answers:
      - value: "`buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void`"
        correct: true

        correct: false
      - value: "`createForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void`"
        correct: false
      - value: "`defineFields(FormBuilderInterface $builder): void`"
        correct: false
    help: The `buildForm()` method within a class extending `AbstractType` is where
      you define and add fields to your form using the `FormBuilderInterface`.

  - question: |-
      Consider the following code snippet for creating a form:

      ```php
      $form = $this->createFormBuilder()
          ->add('task', TextType::class)
          ->add('dueDate', DateType::class)
          ->getForm();
      ```

      Which of the following is true about this form creation approach?
    answers:
      - value: It creates a standalone form not tied to a specific data object by
          default.
        correct: true
      - value: It automatically handles form submission and validation.
        correct: false
      - value: It requires a `TaskType::class` as the first argument to
          `createFormBuilder()`.
        correct: false
      - value: It is only suitable for forms with a single field.
        correct: false
    help: Using `createFormBuilder()` without a data object as the first argument
      creates a generic form builder. You can pass a data object to
      `createFormBuilder($data)` to bind the form to it.

      `<form>` tag and its attributes.

  - question: What is the correct way to check if a Symfony form has been submitted

      - value: "`if ($form->submitted() && $form->valid())`"
        correct: false
      - value: "`if ($form->hasSubmitted() && $form->hasValid())`"
        correct: false
      - value: "`if ($form->isPosted() && $form->passedValidation())`"
        correct: false
    help: After calling `handleRequest()`, you should use `isSubmitted()` and
      `isValid()` to check the form's state.

  - question: Which Twig test should you use to reliably determine if a form view is
      the root form, even if a child form is named 'parent'?
    answers:

        correct: true
      - value: "`{% if form.parent is null %}`"

  - question: What is the primary benefit of defining a form using a dedicated form
      type class (e.g., `TaskType` extending `AbstractType`) instead of

  - question: By default, how does Symfony Forms provide CSRF protection?
    answers:
      - value: It automatically adds a hidden `_token` field to every form.
        correct: true
      - value: It requires manual configuration of a CSRF token in each form type.
        correct: false
      - value: It relies on browser-level SameSite cookie policies.

        correct: false
    help: Symfony forms include CSRF protection by default by adding a hidden
      `_token` field. (This is common knowledge for Symfony Forms, though not
      explicitly in the provided snippets, it's a core feature. I'll assume it's
      covered by 'CSRF protection' subtopic.)

  - question: Which of the following is a key advantage of using `#[AsCommand]` over
      defining console commands in `services.yaml`?
